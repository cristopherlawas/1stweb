        <p><h1>"Push"</h1></p><br><br>

She said I don't know if I've ever been good enough<br>
I'm a little bit rusty, and I think my head is caving in<br>
And I don't know if I've ever been really loved<br>
By a hand that's touched me, well I feel like something's<br>
Gonna give<br>
And I'm a little bit angry, well<br><br>

This ain't over, no not here, not while I still need you<br>
Around<br>
You don't owe me, we might change<br>
Yeah we just might feel good<br><br>

[chorus]<br><br>

I wanna push you around, well I will, I will<br>
I wanna push you down, well I will, I will<br>
I wanna take you for granted, I wanna take you for granted<br>
Well I will<br><br>

She said I don't know why you ever would lie to me<br>
Like I'm a little untrusting when I think that the truth is<br>
Gonna hurt ya<br>
And I don't know why you couldn't just stay with me<br>
You couldn't stand to be near me<br>
When my face don't seem to want to shine<br>
Cuz it's a little bit dirty well<br><br>

Don't just stand there, say nice things to mec<br>
I've been cheated I've been wronged, and you<br>
You don't know me, I can't change<br>
I won't do anything at all<br><br>

[chorus]<br><br>

Oh but don't bowl me over<br>
Just wait a minute well it kinda fell apart, things get so<br>
Crazy, crazy<br>
Don't rush this baby, don't rush this baby<br><br>

[chorus]<br>
